# Coverage

## Coverage Report

This document contains simple coverage output at certain points in the project. The coverage shown is generated everytime the tests are run, and will therefore not be a complete report.

The coverages shown will be taken after a commit has been pushed and consequently the coverage report will include the commit hash in the title.
